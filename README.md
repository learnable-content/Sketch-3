Now let's discuss two new official Sketch plugins that have come out as of the release of Sketch 40. Go to [sketchapp.com](http://sketchapp.com) and then open Extensions.

**SVGO Compressor** compresses the native SVG files that Sketch exports. Sketch is notorious for having very bloated and messy SVG files, so this takes care of that by compressing the file size to the bare essentials, all while keeping the actual image untouched.

**Bitmap Compressor** does the same thing but for raster based images like JPGs and PNGs.

These plugins really come in handy and it's definitely something you want to add to your workflow. So I hope you are able to get a good taste of the updates in Sketch 40 and I hope you enjoyed this course.
