# Creating Typography Styles

## Selecting Fonts for Your Project
Make sure the tone of the font is appropriate for your project and the feeling associated with your project. For example, if you're designing a website for a law firm, you would want to use fonts that are more traditional, and have a more professional look. Alternatively, if you were designing an app for pre-teens, you would want to use fonts that are "loud" and attract attention.

## Pairing fonts
When you're using multiple font families for a project, you need to make sure they work well together. Make sure the two fonts contrast each other, but also make sure they look good together.

**Some Tips:**
- **Stick to 2-3 fonts maximum.** Any good font will have multiple weights that you can use for variety. Anything more just leads to a chaotic design and confuses people.
- **Try a Serif/Sans-serif pairing.** You can often find a serif/sans-serif from the same family for certain fonts (e.g. Droid Sans, Droid Serif)
- **You don't always have to pair fonts.** Depending on the font, you can sometimes get away with jsut using different weights of the same font.

**Some Font Pairings:**
- Freight Sans & Freight Text
- Helvetica Neue & Georgia
- Avenir & Minion
- Istok Web and Lora (Google Fonts)
- Montserrat and Crimson Text (Google Fonts)

## Contrast
Your text should have a high contrast with the background of the page. This allows visitors to read the text clearly. While the obvious solution for this would be to have a pure black text with a pure white background, you can get a more natural look if you make the text *slightly* dark gray, and the background *slightly* off-white. Some shades I like to use are #1f1f1f for the text and ##fafafa for the background.


## Headings
A heading font should be legible, draw attention, and have contrast with the body fonts. Headings typically have a much heavier font weight than the body text.

### Type Scale
A Type scale is a system to create different font sizes for different headings (e.g. H1, H2, H3, etc.)

## Body
It's usually a good idea to have at least a 14px-16px size font for your body font, and create a generous line-height for maximum legibility. For this project, we'll be using a 16px base font to use for the text body with a line-height of 1.5 (or 24px).
